# Hi there!

This is a small personal project I started for two reasons: 
  1) I wanted to check what classes I would be able to take next semester.
  2) I was bored.
  
The idea is to make a program that define your curricular sequence (what courses you need to take and the order you need to take them in, in order to complete your degree), and make your life a little bit easier whenever its time to choose what courses to take next semester. This might not be a big deal in some universities, but it would definately help a lot of people in mine.

So far, I have managed to define what a course is (albeit probably not in the best way XD). The next step is to identify the best data structure to use for implementing the curricular sequence (I'm thinking graphs, but I have not taken any data structures classes) so we can design how the specific nodes of the structure will look like and behave. Afterwards I'm thinking about defining what the different types of electives are and their behaviour, and finally making an interface.

Once I have a finished version that works as intended with one curricular sequence, I wnat to try and expand it so it can work with two sequences with mixed classes (Eg: taking classes from your master's during your bachellor's degree).

Also, I'm just now learning to use Git, so don't judge my repository too harshy. At this point I'm just pressing buttons XD.
